<p>The seed-vessels are of the first importance in ascertaining the several
species of Lathyrus, some being naked, others hairy, some long, others
short, some having a smooth and perfectly even surface, others, as in
the present instance, assuming an uneven or jointed appearance.</p>

<p>Of this genus we have already figured three annual species, common in
flower-gardens, viz. <i>odoratus</i>, <i>tingitanus</i>, and <i>sativus</i>; to these
we now add the <i>articulatus</i>, not altogether so frequently met with, but
meriting a place on the flower-border, as the lively red and delicate
white so conspicuous in its blossoms, causes it to be much admired.</p>

<p>It is a native of Italy, and was cultivated at the Chelsea Garden, in
the time of Mr. <span class="smcap">Rand</span>, anno 1739.</p>

<p>It is a hardy annual, requiring support, and rarely exceeding the height
of two feet, flowering in July and August, and is readily raised from
seeds, which should be sown in the open border at the beginning of
April.</p>

<p>Some plants have a claim on our attention for their utility, some for
their beauty, and some for the singularity of their structure, and the
wonderful nature of their &oelig;conomy; in the last class we must place
the present plant, the flowers of which we recommend to the examination
of such of our readers as may have an opportunity of seeing them; to the
philosophic mind, not captivated with mere shew, they will afford a most
delicious treat.</p>

<p>We first saw this novelty in flower, towards the close of the year 1792,
at the Apothecaries Garden, Chelsea, where Mr. <span class="smcap">Fairbairn</span> informed me,
that he had that season raised several plants of it from seeds,
communicated by Dr. <span class="smcap">J. E. Smith</span>, who received them from Madrid, to which
place they were sent from South-America, and where the plant as Mons.
<span class="smcap">Cavanille</span> informs us, grows spontaneously near Mexico. In October 1793,
we had the pleasure of seeing the plant again in blossom in the
aforesaid garden, raised from seeds which ripened there the preceding
year, but unfortunately from the lateness of their flowering, and the
very great injury the plants had sustained from the Cobweb Mite (<i>Acarus
teliarius</i>) vulgarly called the red Spider, there seemed little prospect
that the seed-vessels would arrive at perfection.</p>

<p>The seeds were sown by Mr. <span class="smcap">Fairbairn</span>, in March, and the plants kept in
the green-house till very late in the summer, when to accelerate their
blowing, they were removed into the dry stove: it is worthy of remark,
that these plants, even late in the autumn, shew no signs of blossoming,
but the flowers at length come forth with almost unexampled rapidity,
and the seed-vessels are formed as quickly, so that if the flowers were
not very numerous, their blossoming period would be of very short
duration; future experience may perhaps point out the means of making
the plant blow earlier: in Spain, the blossoms appeared later than here,
Mons. <span class="smcap">Cavanille</span> observed them in the Royal Garden, in November and
December, most probably in the open ground, as no mention is made of the
plants having been preserved from the weather.</p>

<p>It was not till long after our description was taken, that we had an
opportunity of seeing Mons. <span class="smcap">Cavanille's</span> most accurate and elegant work,
above quoted, in which this plant is first figured and described; we
have selected the most essential parts of his generic character, and
adopted his specific description: there is one point, however, in which
we differ from him; the part which he regards as the fifth Petal, we are
inclined to consider rather as that indescribable something, called by
<span class="smcap">Linn&aelig;us</span> the Nectary, it is indeed of little moment whether we call it a
Petal or a Nectary, but there are several reasons why, strictly
speaking, we cannot regard it as a Petal: in general the number of
Petals correspond with the number of the leaves of the Calyx, those of
the latter are four; the base of this Nectary originates deeper than the
claws of the Petals, springing in fact from the same part as the
Filament, its structure, especially the lower part of it, is evidently
different from that of the Petals, corresponding indeed as nearly as
possible with that of the base of the filament.&mdash;<i>Vid.</i> <span class="smcap">Descer</span>.</p>

<p>Mons. <span class="smcap">Cavanille</span> was induced to call this plant <i>Lopezia</i>, in compliment
to <span class="smcap">Th. Lopez</span>, a Spaniard<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>ROOT annual.</p>

<p>STALK five or six feet high, branched almost to the bottom, square,
of a deep red colour, smooth towards the bottom, slightly hairy
above: <i>Branches</i> like the stalk.</p></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p style="margin-left:.5in;text-indent:-.5in">LEAVES alternate, ovate, pointed, toothed on the edges, more so on
the larger leaves, slightly beset with soft hairs, veins prominent
on the under side, usually running parallel to each other and
unbranched: <i>Leafstalks</i> hairy.</p></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p style="margin-left:.5in;text-indent:-.5in">FLOWERS numerous, from the al&aelig; of the leaves, growing irregularly
on hairy leafy racemi, standing on long slender peduncles, which
hang down as the seed-vessels are produced: in this and some others
of its characters, the plant shews some affinity to the <i>Circ&aelig;a</i>.</p></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p style="margin-left:.5in;text-indent:-.5in">CALYX: a <i>Perianthium</i> of four leaves, sitting on the Germen,
leaves narrow, concave, reddish, with green tips, the lowermost one
widely separated from the others, and placed immediately under the
Nectary, <i>fig.</i> 1.</p></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p style="margin-left:.5in;text-indent:-.5in">COROLLA four <i>Petals</i> of a pale red colour, forming in their mode
of growth the upper half of a circle, the two uppermost linear, of
a deeper colour near the apex, jointed below the middle, with a
small green gland on each joint, standing on short round
footstalks, which are hairy when magnified, the two side Petals
nearly orbicular with long narrow claws, the part between the base
of the Petal and the claw of a deeper red or crimson, <i>fig.</i> 2.</p></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p style="margin-left:.5in;text-indent:-.5in">NECTARY situated below the Petals, perfectly white, somewhat ovate,
the sides folding together, before the flower fully expands, nearly
upright, embracing and containing within it the Pistillum and
Stamen, on touching it ever so slightly with the point of a pin,
while in this state, it suddenly springs back and quits the
Pistillum, the lower elastic part of it is then bent in the form
represented in a magnified view of the flower on the plate, <i>fig.</i>
4. this curious ph&oelig;nomenon has not been noticed by <span class="smcap">Cavanille</span>.</p></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p style="margin-left:.5in;text-indent:-.5in">STAMEN: <i>Filament</i> one, tapering and very slender just below the
Anthera, arising from the same part as (and placed opposite to the
base of) the Nectary the lower part of it broader, somewhat fleshy,
cartilaginous, and of the same nature as the inferior part of the
Nectary, with a groove as that has on the inside, so that before
the flower expands, the bases of each are like two half tubes, the
sides of which, nearly touching each other, wholly enclose the
Pistillum; as the fructification goes forward, the Filament,
endowed also with an elastic power, bends back soon after the
flower is open, betwixt the two uppermost Petals, and becomes
invisible to an inattentive observer; the Anthera, which is large,
is at first yellow, and afterwards dark brown, <i>fig.</i> 5.</p></div>

small villous head, <i>fig.</i> 6. in some of the flowers the Pistillum
appears imperfect, being much shorter than usual, and wanting the
Stigma, perhaps such have not acquired their full growth, <i>fig.</i> 6.</p></div>

because the leaves are for the most part sessile, that is sit close to
the branches, without any or very short footstalks; such they are at
least on the flowering branches when the shrub is in blossom, but at the
close of the summer they are no longer so, the leaves acquiring very
evident footstalks.</p>

<p>It is a native of the more southern parts of Europe, and though in point
of size and elegance it cannot vie with its kindred Laburnum, it is a
deciduous shrub of considerable beauty, rarely exceeding the height of
five or six feet, and producing a great profusion of bright yellow
flowers, which continue in blossom a long while; they make their
appearance in May and June, and are usually succeeded by seed-vessels
which produce ripe seeds, by these the plant is readily propagated.</p>

<p>It is one of the most common shrubs we have, as well as one of the
oldest inhabitants of our shrubberies, being mentioned by <span class="smcap">Parkinson</span> in
his <i>Parad. Terrestris</i>.</p>

<p>We are not acquainted with a tribe of plants which stand more in need of
elucidation than those of this genus; of the vast numbers imported from
the Cape within these few years, where they are chiefly natives, and
that for the most part by way of Holland, few comparatively are well
ascertained; some of them appear subject to great variation, both in the
size and colour of their blossoms (whether in their wild state they are
thus inconstant, or whether there are seminal varieties raised by the
persevering industry of the Dutch Florists, we have not yet had it in
our power satisfactorily to ascertain); others like the present one have
their characters strongly marked, and less variable; in general they are
plants of easy culture, requiring chiefly to be protected from the
effects of frost, the least degree of which is presently fatal to most
of them.</p>

<p>The treatment recommended for the <i>Ixia flexuosa</i> is applicable to this
and the other Cape species.</p>

<p>According to the <i>Hort. Kew.</i> this species was introduced by Mr. <span class="smcap">Masson</span>
in the year 1774.</p>

<p>It flowers from April to June.</p>

<p>The Scarlet Lychnis appears to have been a great favourite with
<span class="smcap">Parkinson</span>, he calls it a glorious flower, and in a wooden print of him
prefixed to his <i>Paradisus Terrestris</i>, we see him represented with a
flower of this sort in his hand of the double kind.</p>

<p>It grows spontaneously in most parts of Russia, and is one of our most
hardy perennials.</p>

<p>The extreme brilliancy of its flowers renders it a plant, in its single
state highly ornamental; when double, its beauty is heightened, and the
duration of it increased.</p>

<p>It flowers in June and July.</p>

<p>The single sort may be increased by parting its roots in autumn, but
more abundantly by seeds, which should be sown in the spring; the double
sort may also be increased by dividing its roots, but more plentifully
by cuttings of the stalk, put in in June, before the flowers make their
appearance; in striking of these, however, there requires some nicety.</p>

<p>This plant is found to succeed best in a rich, loamy, soil; and certain
districts have been found to be more favourable to its growth than
others.</p>

<p>A white and a pale red variety of it in its single state were known to
<span class="smcap">Clusius</span>, and similar varieties of the double kind are said to exist; it
is of little moment whether they do or not, every variation in this
plant from a bright scarlet is in every sense of the word a degeneracy.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Clusius</span>, in his work above referred to, informs us that he found this
plant growing wild in various parts of Germany, in meadows, fields, and
by road sides; that it flowered in June, sometimes the whole summer
through, and ripened its seeds in July and August; the blossoms he found
subject to much variation of colour, being either deep purple, whitish,
or even wholly white: <span class="smcap">Casp. Bauhine</span> notices another variety, in which
the al&aelig; are white and the rostrum purple; this variety, which we have
had the honour to receive from the Earl of <span class="smcap">Egremont</span> is the most
desirable one to cultivate in gardens, as it is more ornamental than the
one wholly purple, most commonly met with in the nurseries, and
corresponds also better with its name of <i>varia</i>; it is to be noted
however that this variety of colour exists only in the young blossoms.</p>

<p>The Coronilla varia is a hardy, perennial, herbaceous plant, climbing,
if supported, to the height of four or five feet, otherwise spreading
widely on the ground, and frequently injuring less robust plants growing
near it; on this account, as well as from its having powerfully creeping
roots whereby it greatly increases, though a pretty plant, and flowering
during most of the summer, it is not to be introduced without caution,
and is rather to be placed in the shrubbery, or outskirts of the garden,
than in the flower border.</p>

<p>It will grow in any soil or situation, but blossoms and seeds most
freely in a soil moderately dry.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Parkinson</span> in his <i>Theater of Plants</i>, mentions its being cultivated, as
an ornamental plant. <i>Ait. Kew.</i></p>

<p>Its bitterness, will be an objection to its being cultivated for the use
of cattle, for which purpose it has been recommended.</p>

<p>At the close of the year 1787, Mr. <span class="smcap">Robert Squibb</span>, sent me from
South-Carolina roots of the Lily here figured, many of which have since
flowered with various persons in this kingdom.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Catesby</span> in his Natural History of Carolina, gives a figure and short
account of it; <span class="smcap">Walter</span> in his <i>Flora Caroliniana</i> describes it under the
name of <i>Lilium Catesb&aelig;i</i>; Mr. <span class="smcap">Salisbury</span> in the first number of his very
magnificent work, lately published, presents us with a very highly
finished likeness of this lily, accompanied by a most accurate and
minute description of it, and judging from some appearances in <span class="smcap">Catesby's</span>
figure, that it was not the <i>Lilium Catesb&aelig;i</i> of <span class="smcap">Walter</span>, names it
<i>spectabile</i>; but as we are assured by Mr. <span class="smcap">Squibb</span>, who assisted his
friend <span class="smcap">Walter</span> in his publication, that it was the lily figured by
<span class="smcap">Catesby</span>, we have continued the name given in honour of that Naturalist.</p>

<p>Of the different Lilies cultivated in this country, this is to be
numbered among the least, the whole plant when in bloom being frequently
little more than a foot high; in its native soil it is described as
growing to the height of two feet; the stalk is terminated by one
upright flower, of the form and colour represented on the plate; we have
observed it to vary considerably in the breadth of its petals, in their
colour, and spots.</p>

<p>It flowers usually in July and August.</p>

<p>This plant may be raised from seeds, or increased by offsets, which,
however, are not very plentifully produced, nor is the plant to be made
grow in perfection without great care, the roots in particular are to be
guarded against frost; the soil and situation may be the same as
recommended for the <i>Cyclamen Coum. p. 4. v. 1</i>.</p>

<p>Though many species of this genus have been raised from seeds, brought
within these few years from the South Seas, where they are said to be
very numerous; this is, we believe, the only one that as yet has
flowered in this country: our drawing was made from a plant which
blossomed toward the close of last summer at Lord <span class="smcap">Cremornes</span>, the root of
which had been sent from Botany-Bay; previous to this period we have
been informed, that the same species flowered both at Kew and
Sion-House: as it is without difficulty raised both from seeds and
cuttings, young plants of it are to be seen in most of the Nurseries
near town; it would seem that they do not flower till they are at least
five or six years old.</p>

<p><i>Metrosideros</i> is a name given originally by <span class="smcap">Rumphius</span> in <i>Herb. Amboin</i>
to some plants of this genus, the term applies to the hardness of their
wood, which by the Dutch is called Yzerhout (Ironwood): <span class="smcap">Forster</span> in his
<i>Gen. Pl.</i> figures this and another genus on the same plate, under the
name of <i>Leptospermum</i>; <span class="smcap">Schreber</span> in his edition of the <i>Gen. Pl.</i> of
<span class="smcap">Linn&aelig;us</span>, unites <i>Metrosideros</i>, <i>Melaleuca</i>, <i>Leptospermum</i>, and
<i>Fabricia</i>, under the genus <i>Melaleuca</i>; <span class="smcap">G&aelig;rtner</span> in his elaborate work
on the seeds of plants, makes separate genera of these, agreeably to the
ideas of Sir <span class="smcap">Joseph Banks</span> and Mr. <span class="smcap">Dryander</span>, who on this subject can
certainly boast the best information.</p>

<p>We cannot, without transgressing the allotted limits of our
letter-press, give a minute description of the plant figured; suffice it
to say, that it is an ever-green shrub, growing to the height of from
four to six or more feet, that its leaves on the old wood feel very
harsh or rigid to the touch, and when bruised give forth an agreeable
fragrance, the flowers grow in spikes on the tops of the branches, and
owe their beauty wholly to the brilliant colour of the filaments.</p>

<p>In the 80th number of this work we gave a figure of the <i>Pelargonium
tricolor</i>, a plant very generally regarded as the most beautiful of the
genus; we now present our readers with the representation of an
<i>Erodium</i>, which has to boast nearly an equal share of admiration.</p>

<p>This species, as we learn from the <i>Hortus Kewensis</i>, is a native of the
Cape, and was introduced by Mr. <span class="smcap">Masson</span> in the year 1787.</p>

<p>Its usual time of flowering is July and August; in this point it is
inferior to the <i>Pelargonium tricolor</i>, which blossoms through the
spring as well as summer months.</p>

<p>It produces seeds but sparingly; cuttings of the plant are struck with
less difficulty than those of the <i>Pelargonium</i> above mentioned, the
same treatment is applicable to both plants, they must be regarded as
green-house plants of the more tender kind, which are liable to be
destroyed in the winter season by a moist cold atmosphere.</p>

<p>Of the many plants which within these few years have been raised from
Botany-Bay seeds, this is one of the first which flowered in this
country, and one of the most ornamental; to the greenhouse it is indeed
an invaluable acquisition: we regret that the size of our paper and the
imperfection of the colouring art, will not admit of our giving a
representation of it more adequate to its beauty.</p>

<p>It rises up with a twining shrubby stalk to the height of six, eight, or
more feet; these multiplying greatly by age, become loaded with a
profusion of purple flowers, growing in racemi, the richness of which is
enlivened by the appearance of two green spots at the base of the
vexillum; for the most part the blossoms go off with us without
producing any seed-vessels; in some instances, however, perfect seeds
have been produced, and we have seen a plant in bloom raised from such
in the charming retreat of <span class="smcap">John Ord</span>, Esq. Walham-Green.</p>

<p>A great excellence of this plant is the duration of its flowering
period, it begins to put forth its blossoms in February, and continues
to do so during most of the summer.</p>

<p>In the Nurseries about town, it is known by the name of <i>Glycine
virens</i>, a name given the plant originally by Dr. <span class="smcap">Solander</span>; the latter
of these terms we have taken the liberty of changing to <i>bimaculata</i>, as
being more expressive of an obvious character in the flower: we might,
perhaps, been justified in altering the genus, as its characters do not
appear to be peculiarly expressive of a Glycine, nor indeed of any other
genus in this numerous natural order.</p>

<p>It is raised readily from seeds.</p>

<p>We think it highly probable, that in warm sheltered situations, this
climber might grow in the open ground; to such as have it in abundance,
we recommend them to make the experiment.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Lee</span>, Nurseryman of Hammersmith, informs me, that in the year 1780,
he raised the Cistus here figured from seeds, the produce of Portugal,
and as its flowers were uncommonly beautiful, he was induced to name it
<i>formosus</i>.</p>

<p>It approaches so near to the <i>Cistus halimifolius</i> in point of habit, in
the form and colour of its leaves and flowers, that we are inclined
rather to regard it as a variety of that plant, than as a distinct
species; at the same time it must be allowed to be a very striking
variety, the flowers being at least thrice as large as those of the
<i>halimifolius</i> usually are, and the whole plant more hairy: as an
ornamental shrub, it is highly deserving a place in all curious
collections.</p>

<p>It will grow very well in the open border in warm sheltered situations,
it may be kept also in a pot, by which means it may more readily be
sheltered during the winter, either in the greenhouse or under a frame.</p>

<p>It flowers early in May, and may be increased by cuttings.</p>

<p>There are three plants cultivated in the gardens of the curious to which
<i>Bulbocodium</i> is applied, either as a generic or a trivial name, viz.
<i>Narcissus Bulbocodium</i>, <i>Bulbocodium vernum</i>, already figured, and the
present plant: the <i>Ixia Bulbocodium</i> and <i>Bulbocodium vernum</i> are given
in this work, not so much for their beauty as their rarity, not so much
to gratify the eye, as to communicate a knowledge of two plants but
little known, and liable to be confounded from a similarity of their
names.</p>

<p>This is one of the few hardy species of the genus, and grows wild in
many parts of Spain and Italy; it is said to have been found in
Guernsey: it affects hilly and dry situations, will grow readily in
almost any soil, especially if fresh, and not infested with vermin: it
flowers about the middle of April, the blossoms do not expand fully
unless exposed to the sun, and are not of long duration: authors
describe the wild plants as varying greatly in colour, <i>vid. Clus.</i> they
are most commonly pale blue.</p>

<p>Like the Crocus, it increases readily by offsets.</p>

<p>Was cultivated by Mr. <span class="smcap">Miller</span>, in 1739, <i>Ait. Kew.</i> Bulbocodium, 1. in
the 6th edition of his Dictionary in 4to, is not this plant, but the
<i>Anthericum scrotinum</i>, <i>Jacq. Fl. Austr. v. 5. app. t. 38.</i></p>

<p>The leaves of the <i>Ranunculus amplexicaulis</i> in part surround the stalk
at their base, whence its trivial name; in colour they differ from most
others of the genus, being of a greyer or more glaucous hue, which
peculiarity joined to the delicate whiteness of the flowers, renders
this species a very desirable one to add to a collection of hardy,
ornamental, herbaceous plants, more especially as it occupies but little
space, and has no tendency to injure the growth of others.</p>

<p>It is a native of the Apennine and Pyrenean mountains, and flowers in
April and May.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Clusius</span> is the first author who describes and figures this species.
<span class="smcap">Johnson</span> in his <i>ed.</i> of <span class="smcap">Gerard</span> copies his figure, and mentions it as
being then made a denizen of our gardens.</p>

<p>It is readily propagated by parting its roots in Autumn, and provided it

<p>The Chinese Apple-Tree when it blossoms in perfection, answers truly to
the name of <i>spectabilis</i>; a more shewy or ornamental tree can scarcely
be introduced to decorate the shrubbery or plantation; its beauty like
that of most trees, whose ornament consists chiefly in their blossoms,
is however but of short duration, and depends in some degree on the
favourableness of the season at the time of their expansion, which
usually takes place about the end of April or beginning of May; the
flowers are large, of a pale red when open, and semi-double, the buds
are of a much deeper hue, the fruit is of little account, and but
sparingly produced. Trees of this species are to be met with in some
gardens of the height of twenty or thirty feet.</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Fothergill</span> is regarded as the first who introduced this Chinese
native, he cultivated it in the year 1780; such plants of it as were in
his collection, passed at his decease into the hands of Messrs. <span class="smcap">Gordon</span>
and <span class="smcap">Thompson</span>, in whose rich and elegant Nursery, at Mile-End, this tree
may be seen in great perfection.</p>

<p>Though perfectly hardy, as its blossoms are liable to be injured by
cutting winds, it will be most proper to plant it in a shelter'd
situation.</p>

<p>It is usually increased by grafting it on the Crab stock.</p>

<p>The plant here figured, and very generally known to the Nurserymen, in
the neighbourhood of London, by the name of <i>Glycine rubicunda</i>, is a
native of New South-Wales, and was introduced to this country about the
same time as the <i>Glycine bimaculata</i> already figured.</p>

<p>It is a shrubby, twining plant, running up to the height of five, six,
or more feet, producing blossoms abundantly from April to June, which
are usually succeeded by seed-vessels which ripen their seeds with us.</p>

<p>The flowers though large and shewy, have a kind of dingy or lurid
appearance, which greatly diminishes their beauty. We have observed the
blossoms of some plants more brilliant than those of others, and we
think it highly probable, that, at some future period, seminal varieties
may be obtained with flowers highly improved in colour.</p>

<p>This species is readily raised from seeds, is of quick growth, and may
be regarded as one of our more hardy green-house plants: probably it may
succeed in the open air, if planted in a warm situation, and sheltered
in inclement seasons.</p>

<p>Authors have given to this species of Ornithogalum the name of
Neapolitan, following <span class="smcap">Clusius</span> by whom the plant is figured and
described, and who so called it, merely on receiving it from Naples; it
may perhaps be doubted whether it be originally a native of Italy. Prof.
<span class="smcap">Jacquin</span> has figured it in his <i>Flora Austriaca</i>, the plant being common
about Vienna, in garden-walks, under hedges, and in meadows, he does not
however, from that circumstance, regard it as an original native there.
<span class="smcap">Casp. Bauhin</span> informs us that <span class="smcap">Honorius Belli</span> sent it him from Crete under
the name of <i>Phalangium</i>, leaving its true habitat to be settled more
precisely hereafter, we shall observe, that it is one of those plants
which soon accommodate themselves to any country; producing a numerous
progeny both from roots and seeds, and by no means nice as to soil or
situation; it is not long before it becomes a weed in the garden, from
whence it is apt like the <i>Hyacinthus racemosus</i>, already figured, to
pass into the field or meadow.</p>

<p>Its flowers, which if not beautiful are singular and delicate, make
their appearance towards the end of April, they are of no long duration,
seldom continuing above a fortnight, and are succeeded by seed-vessels
which produce abundance of ripe seed, by which, as well as by its bulbs,
the plant may be increased.</p>

<p>In the <i>Hortus Kewensis</i> it is set down as a Greenhouse plant, one of
the rare errors which occur in that most useful work.</p>

<p>We here present our readers with another Glycine, very lately raised by
several persons in the neighbourhood of London from Botany-Bay seeds,
and which we have called <i>coccinea</i> from the colour of its blossoms.</p>

<p>It is a shrubby, climbing plant, which, if supported, will grow to the
height of many feet, producing a great number of flowers on its pendant
branches; the leaves, which grow three together, are nearly round, and,
in the older ones especially, are crimped or curled at the edges; the
flowers grow for the most part in pairs, are of a glowing scarlet
colour, at the base of the carina somewhat inclined to purple, the
bottom of the vexillum is decorated with a large yellow spot, verging to
green, which adds much to the beauty of the flower.</p>

<p>It blossoms from April to June, and appears to be fully as much disposed
to produce seed vessels, and perfect seeds, as the <i>rubicunda</i>, and by
which alone it has hitherto been propagated.</p>

<p>We must rank it among the more tender green-house plants.</p>

manner represented in <span class="smcap">Trew's</span> <i>Ehret</i>, where they are painted in gay and
lively colours: in the specimens we have seen, the blossoms have been of
a sulphur colour, shaded in particular parts with very fine pencillings,

as producing only two flowers, <span class="smcap">Linn&aelig;us</span> has observed that they sometimes
produce many, we have seen them do so where the plant has grown in
perfection; in their expansion, which usually takes place in April and
May, they give forth a most agreeable fragrance.</p>

<p>It is a native of the Cape, and other parts of Africa; was cultivated by
Mr. <span class="smcap">Miller</span>, and flowered in the Chelsea Garden in the year 1745. <i>Ait.

<p>The leaves which so characteristically distinguish this species are

<p>The <i>Diosma uniflora</i> another native of the Cape, that never failing
source of vegetable riches, was introduced to the Royal Garden at Kew by
Mr. <span class="smcap">Masson</span> in the year 1775, it flowers in our Green-Houses from April
to June, and is usually propagated by cuttings.</p>

<p>This plant forms a small bushy shrub, the leaves are thickly and
irregularly set on the branches, quite up to the flowers, which stand
singly on their summits, and are larger than those of any other known
species of Diosma, expanding as we have found on trial beyond the size
of half-a-crown, which the blossom does in our figure, though it will
not appear to do so to the eye of most observers; they are without
scent, the calyx is large and continuing, composed of five
ovato-lanceolate leaves, reddish on the upper side, and if viewed from
above visible between the petals; the petals are five in number, much
larger than the calyx, and deciduous, of a white colour with a streak of
red running down the middle of each, surface highly glazed, the stamina
are composed of five short filaments, white and slightly hairy, broad at
their base and tapering gradually to a fine point, by which they are
inserted into the hind part of the anther&aelig;, near the bottom; the
anther&aelig; are as long as the filaments, of a brown purple colour, bending
over the stigma, and opening inwardly, each carrying on the upper part
of its back a gland-like substance, of a pale brown colour: besides
these parts there are five filamentous bodies alternating with, and of
the same length as the stamina, of a white colour, and hairy, each
dilating at its extremity where it is of a reddish hue, and presenting
towards the anther&aelig; an oval somewhat concave surface, which secretes a
viscous liquid; in some flowers that we have examined, and we regret
seeing but few, we have observed these nectaries (for such they may be
strictly called) closely adhering by their viscous summits to the
glandular substances at the back of the anther&aelig;<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>; the germen is
studded with a constellation of little glands, which pour forth, and
almost deluge it with nectar; the stigma is composed of five little
round knobs: seed vessels we have not seen.</p>

<p><i>Borbonia</i> is a genus of plants established by <span class="smcap">Linn&aelig;us</span> in the 6th
edition of his <i>Genera Plantarum</i>; of this genus there are six species
enumerated in the 3d edition of the <i>Species Plant</i>. and two in the
<i>Hort. Kew.</i> the latter of which, the <i>crenata</i>, introduced from the
Cape by Mr. <span class="smcap">Masson</span>, in 1774, is here figured.</p>

<p>It is a small shrubby plant, rarely exceeding the height of three feet,
producing its flowers in a small cluster on the summits of the branches;
these are of a yellow colour, and have nothing about them peculiarly
singular, or beautiful; it is the foliage alone which renders this plant
desirable in a collection.</p>

<p>It flowers from June to August, and in favourable seasons ripens its
seeds, by which the plant is usually propagated.</p>

<p>The Tulip-tree is a native of most parts of North-America, <span class="smcap">Marshall</span>
describes it as often growing to the size of a very large tree, 70 or 80
feet in height, and above 4 feet in diameter; he mentions two varieties,
one with yellow and the other with white wood; that with yellow wood is
soft and brittle, much used for boards, heels of shoes, also turned into
bowls, trenchers, &amp;c. the white is heavy, tough, and hard, and is sawed
into joists, boards, &amp;c. for building.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ray</span> informs us in his <i>Hist. Pl.</i> that this tree was cultivated here by
Bishop <span class="smcap">Compton</span>, in 1688: and from <span class="smcap">Miller</span> we learn, that the first tree
of the kind which flowered in this country, was in the gardens of the
Earl of <span class="smcap">Peterborough</span>, at Parsons-Green, near Fulham; in Mr. <span class="smcap">Ord's</span>
garden, at Walham-Green, there is, among other choice old trees, a very
fine tulip-tree, which is every year covered with blossoms, and which
afforded us the specimen here figured. It flowers in June and July,
rarely ripens its seeds with us, though it does readily in America.</p>

<p>The foliage of this plant is extremely singular, most of the leaves
appearing as if truncated, or cut off at the extremity; they vary
greatly in the division of their lobes, the flowers differ from those of
the tulip in having a calyx, but agree as to the number of petals, which
is six; and so they are described in the sixth edition of the <i>Gen. Pl.</i>
of <span class="smcap">Linn.</span> but in <i>Professor</i> <span class="smcap">Murray's</span> <i>Syst. Veg. Ait. H. K. Linn. Syst.
Nat. ed. 13</i>, by <span class="smcap">Gmelin</span>, 9 are given, this in the first instance must be
a mere typographical error arising from the inversion of the 6.</p>

<p>This tree is found to flourish most in a soil moderately stiff and
moist, is usually raised from seeds, the process of which is amply
described by <span class="smcap">Miller</span> in his Dictionary.</p>

<p>This plant, not unfrequently met with in gardens, is known to most
cultivators by the name of <i>Strawberry Spinach</i>; the leaves somewhat
resembling those of the latter, and the fruit that of the former: <span class="smcap">C.
Bauhine</span> likens its berries to those of the Mulberry, to which they
certainly bear a greater resemblance: in most of the species of this
genus the calyx exhibits a very singular phenomenon, when the flowering
is over, it increases in size, becomes fleshy, and finally pulpy,
containing the ripe seed, which however it does not wholly envelope;
thus from each cluster of flowers growing in the al&aelig; of the leaves are
produced so many berries, of a charming red colour, to which the plant
owes its beauty altogether, for the flowers are small, herbaceous, and
not distinctly visible to the naked eye; they can boast however of being
of the first class in the Linnean system <i>Monandria</i>, to which few
belong.</p>

<p>Strawberry Blite is a hardy annual, growing spontaneously in some parts
of France, Spain, and Tartary; is not a very old inhabitant of our
gardens, Mr. <span class="smcap">Aiton</span> mentioning it as being first cultivated by Mr. <span class="smcap">Miller</span>
in 1759. Its berries are produced from June to September; in their taste
they have nothing to recommend them, though not pleasant they are
harmless.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Clusius</span> we believe to be the first author who gives a figure and
description of it.</p>

<p>It affects a dry soil, and open situation; in such there is no necessity
to give any particular directions for its cultivation, as it comes up
readily from seed spontaneously scattered, so much so as sometimes to
prove a troublesome weed.</p>

<span class="smcap">Masson</span>, in 1774, and is now very generally met with in our green-houses.
It produces its little bells, of a lively red when they first open, from

<p>We may rank the White Lily among the very oldest inhabitants of the
flower-garden; in the time of <span class="smcap">Gerard</span> it was very generally cultivated,
and doubtless at a much earlier period; a plant of such stateliness, so
shewy, so fragrant, and at the same time so much disposed to increase,
would of course soon be found very generally in gardens, into which its
introduction would be accelerated on another account; it was regarded as
a plant of great efficacy; among other extraordinary powers attributed
to it, we are gravely told that it taketh away the wrinkles of the face.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Linn&aelig;us</span> makes it a native of Palestine and Syria; Mr. <span class="smcap">Aiton</span> of the
Levant.</p>

<p>Its blossoms, which open early in July, continue about three weeks, and
when they go off leave the flower-garden greatly thinned of its
inhabitants.</p>

<p>Of the White Lily there are three principal varieties:</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">1. With double flowers.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">2. With flowers blotched with purple.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">3. With striped leaves, or leaves edged with yellow.</span><br />
</p>

<p>The two first of these are to be esteemed merely as curiosities; in the
third the plant acquires an accession of beauty which it has not
originally; though many persons object to variegated leaves, as
conveying an idea of fickliness, that complaint cannot be urged against
the foliage of the striped Lily, to which the borders of the
flower-garden are indebted for one of their chief ornaments during the
autumnal and winter months; early in September these begin to emerge,
and towards spring another set rises up in their centre, of more upright
growth, and which announce the rising of the flowering stem.</p>

<p>Besides these varieties, <span class="smcap">Linn&aelig;us</span> has considered the <i>Lilium album
floribus dependentibus s. peregrinum</i> of <span class="smcap">C. Bauhine</span>, the <i>Sultan
Zambach</i> of <span class="smcap">Clusius</span>, and the <i>Hortus Eystettensis</i>, as one of its
varieties also: <span class="smcap">Miller</span> regards this plant as a distinct species, and
those who have attentively examined the figures and descriptions of
<span class="smcap">Clusius</span> and the <i>Hort. Eyst.</i> will be of the same opinion.</p>

<p>The Lily increases most abundantly by offsets, hence it becomes
necessary that the bulbs should be taken up, and reduced every second or
third year; but the striped leaved variety increasing much more slowly,
should remain unmolested for a greater length of time.</p>

<p>There is scarcely a soil or situation in which the Lily will not grow,
it will thrive most in a soil moderately stiff and moist; though a
native of a warm climate no severity of weather affects it with us: we
may learn from this, not to regulate the culture of plants invariably by
the climate in which they grow spontaneously.</p>

<p>The best time for removing the bulbs of this plant is about the middle
of August, before they shoot forth their leaves; but they may be
transplanted any time from September to spring.</p>

<p><i>Plumeria</i> is a genus of plants named by <span class="smcap">Tournefort</span> in honour of his
countryman the celebrated <span class="smcap">Plumier</span>, it comes near to Nerium or Oleander,
and contains several species, all natives of warm climates.</p>

<p>The present plant is a native of Jamaica, where it is known by the name
of Red Jasmine, from whence seeds and large cuttings are often sent to
this country; here they require the stove to bring them to flower:
seed-vessels they are never known to produce.</p>

<p>The flowers, which are very odoriferous, are produced in July and August
in large bunches, on the summits of the branches, from whence the leaves
also proceed; the stems, which grow to a considerable height as well as
thickness, are naked, and the whole plant loses its foliage from the
middle of winter till about the beginning of May; the branches and other
parts of the plant, when broken off, give forth a milky juice, the
leaves are handsome, and the veins remarkable.</p>

<p>Being too tender to bear the open air of this climate, it is kept in the
stove even during summer, in hot weather it must have plenty of air, and
in cold seasons be sparingly watered.</p>

<p>Is propagated by seeds, but more frequently by cuttings, which <span class="smcap">Miller</span>
recommends to be put by for two months or ten weeks, previous to their
being committed to the earth.</p>

<p>In addition to the powerful recommendations of beauty and fragrance, the
Tutsan-leav'd Dogsbane interests us on account of the curious structure

years, brought me some seeds of it gathered in that neighbourhood, which

in 1731.</p>

<p>It is a hardy perennial plant, growing to about the height of a foot and
a half, or two feet, and flowering from the beginning of July, to
September; it has a creeping root, thereby it increases greatly in light
dry soils, and warm situations, so as even to be troublesome; it will
not thrive in a wet soil; with us it produces seed-vessels but rarely;
is propagated by parting its roots in Autumn or Spring; <span class="smcap">Miller</span>
recommends March as the most proper season, or it may be raised from
seeds, which in certain situations and seasons ripen here.</p>

<p>The flowers of this Apocynum have a sweet honey-like fragrance, which
perfumes the air to a considerable distance, and no doubt operates
powerfully in attracting insects; when a plant of this sort is fully
blown, one may always find flies caught in its blossoms, usually by the
trunk, very rarely by the leg; sometimes four, or even five, which is
the greatest possible number, are found in one flower, some dead, others
endeavouring to disentangle themselves, in which they are now and then
so fortunate as to succeed; these flies are of different species, the
<i>musca pipiens</i>, a slender variegated fly with thick thighs, is a very
common victim, the <i>musca domestica</i>, or house fly, we have never
observed among the captives.</p>

<p>Previous to our explaining the manner in which it appears to us that
these insects are caught, it will be necessary that we should describe,
in as plain a manner as possible, those parts of the flower which more
particularly constitute this fatal fly trap.</p>

<p>On looking into the flower we perceive five Stamina, the Anther&aelig; of
which are large, of a yellow colour, and converge into a kind of cone;
each of these Anther&aelig; is arrow-shaped, towards the top of the cone their
sides touch but do not adhere, below they separate a little, so as to
leave a very narrow opening or slit between each, they are placed on
very short filaments, which stand so far apart that a considerable
opening is left between them, which openings, however, are closed up by
processes of the corolla, nicely adapted to, and projecting into them;
at the bottom of, and in the very centre of the flower, we perceive two
germina, or seed-buds, the rudiments of future seed-vessels, surrounded
by glandular substances, secreting a sweet liquid; on the summit of
these germina, and betwixt the two, stands the stigma, in the form of a
little urn, the middle of which is encircled by a glandular ring, which
secretes a viscid honey-like substance, to this part of the stigma the
Anther&aelig; interiorly adhere most tenaciously, so as to prevent their
separation unless considerable force be applied; it is, as we apprehend,
the sweet viscid substance thus secreted by the stigma, within the
Anther&aelig;, which the fly endeavours to obtain, and to this end insinuates
its trunk first into the lowermost and widest part of the slit, betwixt
each of the Anther&aelig; above described, pushing it of necessity upwards:
when gratified, not having the sense to place itself in the same
position as that in which it stood when it inserted its trunk, and to
draw it out in the same direction downwards, unfortunately for it, it
varies its position, and pulling its trunk upwards, draws it into the
narrow part of the slit, where it becomes closely wedged in, and the
more it pulls the more securely it is caught, and thus this heedless
insect, as <span class="smcap">Thomson</span> calls it, terminates its existence in captivity most
miserable.</p>

<p>In the incomparable poem of Dr. <span class="smcap">Darwin</span>, entitled the <i>Botanic Garden</i>,
there is a figure given of this plant; and in the Supplement we have the
following account written by Mr. <span class="smcap">Darwin</span>, of Elston.</p>

<p>"In the Apocynum Andros&aelig;mifolium the Anthers converge over the
nectaries, which consist of five glandular oval corpuscles, surrounding
the germ, and at the same time admit air to the nectaries at the
interstice between each anther; but when a fly inserts its proboscis
between these anthers to plunder the honey, they converge closer, and
with such violence as to detain the fly, which thus generally perishes."</p>

<p>This explanation of a ph&aelig;nomenon entitled to much attention, is widely
different from ours; which of the two is most consonant to truth and
nature, we shall leave to the determination of future observers.</p>

<p>In explaining the preceding appearances, to prevent confusion we called
those parts which form the cone in the middle of the flower Anther&aelig;, but
strictly speaking they are not such, the true Anther&aelig; being situated on
the inside of their summits, where they will be found to be ten in
number, making in fact the Apocynum a decandrous plant.</p>

<p>This plant here represented is generally known to the Nurserymen about
London as the <i>Turnera ulmifolia</i>, or <i>Elm-leav'd Turnera</i>, its foliage
however does not answer to the name, nor to the figures of the plant as
given by <span class="smcap">Martyn</span> in his <i>Cent. Pl.</i> and <span class="smcap">Linn&aelig;us</span> in his <i>Hortus
Cliffortianus</i>, which figures indeed are so similar that they look like
copies of each other, these represent the true elm leaf; on the same
plate of <i>Martyn's Cent.</i> there is given a very excellent figure of what
he considers as another species of Turnera, vide Synon. and which
<span class="smcap">Miller</span>, who cultivated it about the year 1773, also describes as a
distinct species, under the name of <i>angustifolia</i>, asserting, from the
experience of thirty years, that plants raised from its seeds have
constantly differed from those of the <i>ulmifolia</i>; this is our plant,
which on his authority we have given as a species, though <span class="smcap">Linn&aelig;us</span>
regards it as a variety.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Plumier</span> gave to this genus the name of <i>Turnera</i>, in honour of Dr.
<span class="smcap">William Turner</span>, a celebrated English Botanist and Physician, who
published an Herbal, black letter, folio, in 1568.</p>

<p>The present species is a native of the West-Indies, and is commonly
cultivated in our stoves, where it rises with a semi-shrubby stalk, to
the height of several feet, seldom continuing more than two or three
years; young plants generally come up in plenty from seeds spontaneously
scattered, so that a succession is easily obtained.</p>

<p>It flowers from June to August.</p>

<p>Its foliage has a disagreeable smell when bruised; its flowers are
shewy, but of short duration, and are remarkable for growing out of the
footstalk of the leaf.</p>

<p>Prof. <span class="smcap">Jacquin</span>, in the second volume of the <i>Flora austriaca</i>, gives an
excellent figure and accurate description of our plant, a native of the
Alps of Germany and Switzerland, and points out the characters in which
it differs from the <i>alpinum</i>, for which it has sometimes been mistaken.</p>

<p>It is a hardy perennial, rarely exceeding a foot in height, produces its
spikes of pendulous flowers, which are of a most beautiful purple
colour, in July and August; hitherto these have not been succeeded by
seed-vessels with us; though we have cultivated the plant for several
years.</p>

<p>Its size renders it a suitable plant for rock-work, on which it will
grow readily, increasing by its roots, which are of the creeping kind.</p>

as a native of Virginia, and says of it, "maddidis gaudet locis," it
delights in wet places: <span class="smcap">Linn&aelig;us</span> makes it a native of Canada also.</p>

<p>It is a hardy, perennial, herbaceous plant, growing with us to the
height of about two feet, and producing its flowers, which are of a pale
violet colour, in July and August; these are frequently succeeded by
capsules containing perfect seeds, by which the plant may be propagated,

<p>We are induced to consider the rose here represented, as one of the most
desirable plants in point of ornament ever introduced to this country;
its flowers, large in proportion to the plant, are semi-double, and with
great richness of colour unite a most delightful fragrance; they blossom
during the whole of the year, more sparingly indeed in the winter
months; the shrub itself is more hardy than most greenhouse plants, and
will grow in so small a compass of earth, that it may be reared almost
in a coffee cup; is kept with the least possible trouble, and propagated
without difficulty by cuttings or suckers.</p>

<p>For this invaluable acquisition, our country is indebted to the late
<span class="smcap">Gilbert Slater</span>, Esq. of Knots-Green, near Laytonstone, whose untimely
death every person must deplore, who is a friend to improvements in
ornamental gardening: in procuring the rarer plants from abroad, more
particularly from the East-Indies, Mr. <span class="smcap">Slater</span> was indefatigable, nor was
he less anxious to have them in the greatest perfection this country
will admit; to gain this point there was no contrivance that ingenuity
could suggest, no labour, no expence withheld; such exertions must soon
have insured him the first collection of the plants of India: it is now
about three years since he obtained this rose from China; as he readily
imparted his most valuable acquisitions to those who were most likely to
increase them, this plant soon became conspicuous in the collections of
the principal Nurserymen near town, and in the course of a few years
will, no doubt, decorate the window of every amateur.</p>

<p>The largest plants we have seen have not exceeded three feet, it may no
doubt be trained to a much greater height; a variety of it much more
robust, having usually several flowers on a footstalk, of a pale red
colour, and semi-double also, has more lately been introduced, and as
far as we can learn from the same source.</p>

<p>The flowers of most of the species of Jasmine are odoriferous, trivial
names therefore expressive of this quality are ineligible, as wanting
character; the present name is peculiarly objectionable, inasmuch as
several other species are greatly superior to this in point of
fragrance; a lesson for Botanists to abstain from trivial names of the
superlative degree, such as <i>odoratissimum</i>, <i>f&oelig;tidissimum</i>,
<i>maximum</i>, <i>minimum</i>, &amp;c.</p>

<p>The present species, according to Mr. <span class="smcap">Aiton</span>, is a native of Madeira, and
was cultivated by Mr. <span class="smcap">Miller</span>, in 1730; it is now a plant common in most
greenhouses: it will form a shrub of considerable size, which requires
no support; its leaves are glossy, inclining to yellow, growing for the
most part three together, sometimes pinnated; its blossoms, which are
yellow, make their appearance from May to November: in point of
hardiness it is superior to many greenhouse plants, and may be
propagated without difficulty by cuttings.</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Brown</span>, in his Natural History of Jamaica, gives to this genus the
name of <i>Portlandia</i>, in honour of the Duchess Dowager of <span class="smcap">Portland</span>, who
employed many of the leisure hours of a long and happy life, in the
pursuits of natural history, in which she was eminently skilled.&mdash;She
was the friend and patron of Mr. <span class="smcap">Lightfoot</span>, who dedicates to her his
<i>Flora Scotica</i>; the fine collection of rare and valuable trees and
shrubs which enrich part of the grounds at Bulstrode, were of her
planting.</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Swartz</span>, in his Observations on the Plants of the West-Indies,
informs us, that this species grows wild in Jamaica, where (<i>incolit
calcareosa petrosa</i>) it inhabits calcareous rocky places<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a>, forms a
small tree about the height of six feet, and flowers from the middle of
Summer to Autumn; its bark, he observes, as in other plants of the same
genus, is extremely bitter.</p>

<p>From Mr. <span class="smcap">Aiton</span> we learn, that it was introduced here by &mdash;&mdash; <span class="smcap">Ellis</span>, Esq.
in 1775.</p>

<p>It forms a very beautiful stove plant, not of difficult growth, and
readily disposed to flower; we have seen blowing plants of it little
more than a foot high; its blossoms are not only uncommonly large,
shewy, and curious in their structure, but fragrant also, and very much
so when dried.</p>

<p>It is usually increased by cuttings.</p>

<p>In the Autumn of 1792, <span class="smcap">Samuel Tolfrey</span> Esq. most kindly invited me to
inspect a vast number of the natural productions of Botany-Bay, in his
possession; collected with great assiduity, and brought over in high
preservation by Captain <span class="smcap">Tench</span>; among other curiosities, he shewed me
specimens of the earths of that country, imported in very small bags. I
suggested to Mr. <span class="smcap">Tolfrey</span>, that those earths might possibly contain the
seeds of some curious and unknown plants; he readily acquiesced in the
idea, and permitted me to make trial of them: accordingly, in the Spring
of 1793, I exposed them in shallow pans, on a gentle tan heat, keeping
them duly watered; in the course of the Summer they yielded me fourteen
plants, most of which were altogether new, and among others the species
of <i>Goodenia</i> here figured; this we have since found to be a hardy
greenhouse plant, flowering from July to October, and very readily
increased by cuttings.</p>

<p>The oldest plant in our possession is about a foot and a half high, much
branched, the stalks are round and smooth to the naked eye, green below,
above purplish, the leaves are smooth, a deep bright green colour,
alternate, standing on footstalks, which gradually widen into the
leaves, somewhat ovate, and deeply toothed; the flowers grow in the al&aelig;
of the leaves, forming a thin spike, they are sessile, of a pale violet
colour, and have a peculiar smell which is rather unpleasant; at the
side of each flower are two long narrow Bracte&aelig;; the Calyx, which is
placed on the germen, is composed of five short ovate leaves, which
appear edged with hairs if magnified; the Corolla is monopetalous, the
lower part, which at first is tubular, splits longitudinally above, and
forms a kind of half tube, the edges of which are brown, the inside
yellow, the outside greenish, the mouth beset with short hairs, each of
which is terminated by a small villous head; the limb is deeply divided
into five linear segments, spreading out like a hand, and terminated by
short points; the Filaments are five in number, of a whitish colour,
somewhat broadest above, rather flat, inserted into the receptacle;
Anther&aelig; oval, flattened, yellow, bilocular, a little bent, the length of
the pistillum; but this is to be understood of such flowers as are not
yet fully expanded, in those that are, they are much shorter, and appear
withered; the Style, in flowers about to open, the length of the
filaments, upright, in those that are opened much longer, and bent
somewhat downward; Stigma at first upright, in the form of a cup,
having the edge curiously fringed with white hairs, afterwards it closes
together, loses its hollow, and assumes a flat appearance, and nods
somewhat, the back part of it is bearded; Germen beneath the calyx,
oblong, usually abortive with us.</p>

<p>The name of <i>Goodenia</i> has been given to this genus by Dr. <span class="smcap">Smith</span>, in
honour of the Rev. <span class="smcap">Samuel Goodenough</span>, LL. D. of <i>Ealing</i>, my
much-honoured friend, whose name will be ever dear to Botanists for his
laborious investigation of the British Carices<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a>.</p>

<p>This Passion-Flower is described in the <i>Hort. Kew.</i> as a new one, under
the name of <i>ciliata</i>, introduced by Mrs. <span class="smcap">Norman</span>, from the West-Indies,
in 1783: we saw it during the latter part of the last Summer, with great
profusion of flowers, in several collections, more particularly in that
of Mr. <span class="smcap">Vere</span>, Kensington-Gore, from whence our figure and description
were taken.</p>

<p>Its stalks are round, perfectly smooth, and run to a very great height;
leaves dark green, glossy, perfectly smooth, except on the edges, where
they are beset with strong glandular hairs, divided into three large and
two small lobes, the middle lobe running out to a considerable length,
the footstalks of the leaves are beset with a few hairs thinly
scattered, at the base of each leaf is a tendril, and two finely-divided
stipul&aelig;, edged also with glandular hairs. The Involucrum is composed of
three leaves, dividing into capillary segments, each of which terminates
in a viscid globule, fetid when bruised; betwixt the involucrum and the
blossom is a short peduncle; the pillar which supports the germen is of
a bright purple colour, with spots of a darker hue, the germen is smooth
and green; Styles green; Stigmata of a dark green; Filaments six in
number; Anther&aelig; pale yellow green, the former dotted with purple; of
Radii, there may be said to be four rows, variegated with white and
purple, petals ten, externally greenish, internally red, deeper or paler
according to circumstances.</p>

<p>The leaves of this plant vary greatly in form, according to the health
and luxuriance of the plant; on comparing it with the <i>f&oelig;tida</i>, we
strongly suspect it to be a variety merely of that species: time will
shew.</p>

<p>It is increased by cuttings, or seeds.</p>
